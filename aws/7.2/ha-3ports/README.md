This deployment can be automated using GitHub Actions workflow. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Configure AWS credentials in repository secrets:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Deployment Steps
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select **"Deploy FortiGate to AWS"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** and configure:
   - **FortiGate Version**: Select the version (matches this folder)
   - **Deployment Type**: Select the deployment type (matches this folder)
   - **AWS Region**: Choose your target region
   - **Environment**: Select environment (dev/staging/prod)
4. Click **"Run workflow"** to start deployment

### Deployment Parameters
Configure the following parameters when running the workflow:

**Required Parameters:**
- **FortiGate Version**: Select the version (6.2, 6.4, 7.0, 7.2, 7.4, 7.6)

- **SSH Key Pair Name**: Existing AWS SSH key pair name for access

**Optional Parameters:**
- **VPC CIDR**: VPC CIDR block (default: 10.1.0.0/16)
- **Admin Port**: FortiGate admin port (default: 8443)
- **Environment**: Deployment environment (dev/staging/prod)



The workflow will automatically:
- Validate the deployment path exists
- Initialize Terraform
- Plan the deployment
- Apply the configuration
- Provide deployment summary

### Manual Deployment
For manual deployment, continue with the instructions below.


## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy a FortiGate-VM Cluster on AWS for Cross-AZ deployment with 3 ports only 

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 1.0.9
* Terraform Provider AWS 3.63.0
* Terraform Provider Template 2.2.0
* Needs to have FOS v7.0 later that supports the hasync/hamgmt single port feature.


## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A AWS VPC with 6 subnets.  3 subnets in one AZ.  3 subnets in second AZ.
   - Two FortiGate-VM (PAYG) instances with three NICs. (port1 - wan, port2 - internal, port3 - hasync/hamgmt).
     In this setup, both hasync and hamgmt port will be on port3 instead of separate on different ports.
   - Two Network Security Group rules: one for external, one for internal.
   - Two Route tables: one for internal subnet and one for external subnet.

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to AWS:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables in the `terraform.tfvars.example` and `variables.tf` file as needed.  And rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`.
> [!NOTE]
> In the license_format variable, there are two different choices.
> Either token or file.  Token is FortiFlex token, and file is FortiGate-VM license file.
3. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
4. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
5. Verify output.
6. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
7. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
Outputs:

FGTActiveMGMTPublicIP = <Active FGT Management Public IP>
FGTClusterPublicFQDN = <Cluster Public FQDN>
FGTClusterPublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
FGTPassiveMGMTPublicIP = <Passive FGT Management Public IP>
Password = <FGT Password>
Username = <FGT admin>

```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
