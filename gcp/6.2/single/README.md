   - Two firewall rules, one for external, one for internal subnet

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM GCP:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Change to the XXXX directory.  Put the GCP service account key file as account.json in the folder.
     Then, customize the setting in the vars.tf file  and initialize the providers and modules:

     ```sh
     $ cd XXXXX
     $ terraform init
     ```

  3. Submit the Terraform plan using the command below.

     ```sh
     $ terraform plan
     ```

  4. Verify output.
  5. Confirm and apply the plan:

     ```sh
     $ terraform apply
     ```

  6. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.
  7. After the deployment, user can login to the FortiGate-VM instance via the output information.

     ```sh
     Outputs:

        FortiGate-InstanceName = fgtnat-ebc
        FortiGate-NATIP = <FGT public IP>
        FortiGate-Password = 2241809026172529827
        FortiGate-Username = admin
     ```

To destroy the instance, use the command:

        ```sh
    $ terraform destroy
    ```
