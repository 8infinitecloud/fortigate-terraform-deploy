     $ terraform plan
     ```

  4. Verify output.
  5. Confirm and apply the plan:

     ```sh
     $ terraform apply
     ```

  6. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.
  7. After the deployment, user can login to the FortiGate-VM instance via the output information.

     ```sh
     Outputs:
	FortiGate-HA-Cluster-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
	FortiGate-HA-Master-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
	FortiGate-HA-Slave-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
	FortiGate-Password = <password here>
